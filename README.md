# Classic-Products-Sales-Dashboard
I was tasked with designing a power Bi dashboard that provides insights into the performace of Classic model product lines 
– including profitability, regional performance and average order value. The dashboard will be used by the sales leadership team to track performance across various dimensions such as country, office, product line and cost of sales
My Motivations
•	Understand where net profit is strongest and weakest
•	Compare product line across markets
•	Use visuals to influence strategic decisions during monthly review meetings
•	Ensure quick acess to KPIs with the ability to toggle between net profit and Sales data
